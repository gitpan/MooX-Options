You can skip some option to remove them to the terminal. In that case, the 'option' keyword will just works like an 'has'.

  use MooX::Options skip_options => [qw/multi/];

If you have multiple tools that use the same Role with options, you can skip one and force his value.
In my example, it could be a multithread option that you want to disable in some cases.
